# Capstone Project: Analyzing Natural Disasters Worldwide
This project aims to analyze natural disasters worldwide since 1990 using the EM-DAT: The International Disaster Database. The EM-DAT database is maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and contains data on the occurrence and effects of thousands of disasters around the world.
## Data Sources
- [EM-DAT - Country Profiles - Humanitarian Data Exchange (humdata.org)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/emdat-country-profiles)
- [EM-DAT | The international disasters database (emdat.be)](https://www.emdat.be/)
## Project Plan
1. Clean and process the data using SQL and SSIS. Create one fact table and six dimension tables. The dimension tables will include the following:
* Year (century, year duration).
* Country (capital, continent, longitude, latitude etc.).
* Disaster group.
* Disaster subgroup.
* Disaster type.
* Disaster subtype.
2. Use Python to choose statistical models, train the models, test and validate the models and predictions.
3. Create visualizations to communicate the insights gathered from the data effectively.
## Technologies Used
* SQL
* SSIS
* Python
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* seaborn
