  <h1>Google Play Store Data Analysis</h1>
</p>

This project aims to analyze 10k of web-scraped Play Store apps data for analyzing the Android market. The dataset is from 'Google Play Store Apps' from Kaggle. This data analysis aims to be useful for app developers to see how certain aspects of their app will affect downloads and ratings and to help stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize their apps' performance, enhance user experience, and achieve their goals in the Google Play Store.
## Data Sources
- [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)   from Kaggle website
## Objective:
:wrench: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Utilize Python's data manipulation libraries such as Pandas or NumPy to clean, preprocess, and transform the extracted data into a structured format that is suitable for analysis.

:bar_chart: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Employ Python's data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to perform EDA, including generating descriptive statistics, visualizing app metrics, identifying patterns, and uncovering insights from the data.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Market Trend Analysis
Utilize Python's data analysis tools to identify market trends, such as popular app categories or emerging markets, to inform app development, marketing strategies, and business decisions.

## Problem Statement:

This repository contains data analysis on the "googleplaystore.csv" file, aiming to solve the following problems:

:red_circle: Distribution of App Ratings, Reviews, and Installs**

To analyze the distribution of app ratings, reviews, and install numbers, and gain insights into the overall satisfaction of users with different apps. This analysis could help app developers understand user preferences and make informed decisions about app improvements.

:yellow_circle: Distribution of Apps across Categories and Genres**

To analyze the distribution of apps across different categories and genres, identify popular categories or genres, and gain insights into market trends. This analysis could help app developers make strategic decisions about app development and marketing strategies.

:large_blue_circle: Analysis of App Pricing Strategies**

To analyze the distribution of app prices, identify trends in app pricing strategies, and gain insights into the impact of app pricing on app performance. This analysis could help app developers determine optimal pricing strategies for their apps and improve revenue generation.

## Use Case: 

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of app performance and user preferences, which can inform strategic decision-making for app developers. There are three Key Benefits of the Analysis:

:key: Provides valuable insights into user preferences and app performance, helping app developers make informed decisions for app improvements.

:key: Identifies market trends and popular categories/genres, guiding strategic app development and marketing strategies.

:key: Helps optimize app pricing strategies for revenue generation and improved app performance.
